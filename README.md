## All in One Health

### Collaboration

### What and why?
All in One Health is an app/website that consolidates, organizes and analyzes user health data. While this is not a new concept, existing apps are not very practical for users and may not be supported by every hospital or medical professional. Every doctor also works separately so those with multiple doctors can have trouble managing all the data they are given. 

In order to make understanding ones health easier, All in One Health strives to create an app that can be easily personalized to each individual while providing utility for everyone. The app would have utility for all patients while also providing extra features to help those with more needs.
This app would be made for desktop or mobile. 

### For whom?
All in One Health aims to be useful to everyone of the general public but more specifically to patients who have medical conditions to keep track of. This app can keep track of data and even analyze that data with charts for those who don’t know how to easily keep track of their data (such as with excel charts) or don’t have the time to do so. An example, is those keeping track of their blood sugar everyday.

For medical professionals, this app can make it easy to see trends in a patients health easily, which aren’t easily found on a patients medical charts. This can make helping long term patients easier and much more meaningful.  Medical professionals would also have access to a patients basic health details without the delays of calling others to get the data.

But in general, this app focuses on everyone to get more involved with their health and to make it easier for them to do so. 

### How?
The app should be clean and easy to use but also adaptable. 
The basic functions are:
- Appointments and Alerts:
  - Keeping track of appointments, prescription refill times and daily tracking reminders (such as inputing the daily blood sugar after it is taken). 
  - Also there would be the option to have alerts. 
- Medical History:  
  - This is the users medical history. This can be adaptable to the patient, and have more or less data. 
  - The basic should be any medical or hospital visits with a summary of those visits.
  - Vaccination history 
  - Any tests and subsequent information (such as blood tests). 
    - These would be sorted by date , by default, and can be separated. 
    - This could have options to track any categories for ease of looking at, such as wanting to see the history of one’s cholesterol.  
- User Profile:
  - This will have the basic emergency information of the patient and any immediate concerns listed. For example, any allergies, or immediate health conditions.
  - There can also be a section for family health conditions which can be inputted manually or be linked to other users that are family. 
This would be basic functionality but this design can be expanded to include more features. 

### Scope
In terms of scope, this project is easily adaptable to be complete with any number of features. 
Since the app is structured with different sections, collaboratively working is made easier and there is ease in splitting work between a team with minimal worry for merge conflicts. 

The app also makes it so that there is never a time that there will be no work for anyone in the team. There are so many ways to expand and enhance the app while still having room to stop when the basics are in place for full functionality. 

In general, the project is able to be scaled based on the team size and the time. While seemingly simple, there is a lot of features to be added. If planned appropriately, there won't be an issue of running out of time to present a completed project.
